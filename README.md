# Financial - backend
This is the backend of my main project https://github.com/diegoserrat/finance-control

## Description 
- Is backend of my own project to study. 
- Is not my interest to focus in backend, but I think Is good to study to understand how it works "the other side" of developing a system.


## Development server
- To run the system first of all use: npm install.
- After install packages from node_modules use `node index` inside of src folder.
