# Financial - backend
This is the backend of my main project https://github.com/diegoserrat/finance-control

## Description 
- Is backend of my own project to study. 
- Is not my interest to focus in backend, but I think Is good to study to understand how it works "the other side" of developing a system.


## Finance control backend
This project it's just to be used with my project, isn't my great skill, as I said before it's just to used to a database for my studies on my project ( https://github.com/diegoserrat/finance-control ).
- To run the system first of all use: npm install.
- npm run start => to run the project
